ABSTRACT = {This paper provides the Agent in a Box for developing autonomous mobile robots using Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This framework provides the means of connecting the agent reasoning system to the environment, using the Robot Operating System (ROS), in a way that is flexible to a variety of application domains which use different sensors and actuators. It also provides the needed customisation to the agent’s reasoner for ensuring that the agent’s behaviours are properly prioritised. Behaviours which are common to all mobile robots, such as for navigation and resource management, are provided. This allows developers for specific application domains to focus on domain-specific code. Agents implemented using this approach are rational, mission capable, safety conscious, fuel autonomous, and understandable. This method was used for demonstrating the capability of BDI agents to control robots for a variety of application domains. These included simple grid environments, a simulated autonomous car, and a prototype mail delivery robot. From these case studies, the approach was demonstrated as capable of controlling the robots in the application domains. It also reduced the development burden needed for applying the approach to a specific robot.},

ABSTRACT = {Autonomous systems developed with the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architecture tend to be mostly implemented in simulated environments. In this project we sought to build a BDI agent for use in the real world for campus mail delivery in the tunnel system at Carleton University. Ideally, the robot should receive a delivery order via a mobile application, pick up the mail at a station, navigate the tunnels to the destination station, and notify the recipient. In this paper, we discuss how we linked the Robot Operating System (ROS) with a BDI reasoning system to achieve a subset of the required use casesand demonstrated the system performance in an analogue environment. ROS handles the connections to the low-level sensors and actuators, while the BDI reasoning system handles the high-level reasoning and decision making. Sensory data is sent to the reasoning system as perceptions using ROS. These perceptions are then deliberated upon, and an action string is sent back to ROS for interpretation and driving of the necessary actuator for the action to be performed. In this paper we present our current implementation, which closes the loop on the hardware-software integration and implements a subset of the use cases required for the full system. We demonstrated the performance of the system in an analogue environment.},
